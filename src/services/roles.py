    A class to manage access control based on user roles.

    This class is designed to be used as a dependency in FastAPI endpoints to restrict access to certain roles.

    Attributes:
        allowed_roles (list[Role]): A list of roles that are allowed to access the endpoint.

    Methods:
        __call__(request: Request, user: User = Depends(auth_service.get_current_user)):
            This method is called when the class instance is used as a dependency. It checks if the user's role
            is in the list of allowed roles. If the user's role is not allowed, it raises an HTTPException with
            a 403 status code.
